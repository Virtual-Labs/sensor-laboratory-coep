* Objective
  - To view the PH Simulator of  “Simulate the performance of a chemical sensor” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/sensor-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Simulate the performance of a chemical sensor/Simulate the performance of a chemical sensor_01_Usability_smk.org][Simulate the performance of a chemical sensor_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the PH Simulator link 
  2. It should re-direct to the PH Simulator page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for PH Simulator' link
  4. Select the PH value from the dropdown list displayed on the screen and click on the 'plot' button
  5. Now click on the escape button through keyboard or close button
  6. Click on the level 2 button and don't select the sample value from the dropdown list displayed on the screen and click on the submit button

* Expected result
  1. PH Simulator page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new page should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The pH and OUTPUT mV values should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the plot button, a popup box with the result ghraph should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the close button the popup box should be closed
  6. The level2 simulation page should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the submit button an error message should be displayed on the screen as to select the sample type
