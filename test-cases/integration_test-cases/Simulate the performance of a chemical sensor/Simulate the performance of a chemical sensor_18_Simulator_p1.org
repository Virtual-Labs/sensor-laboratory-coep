* Objective
  - To view the PH Simulator of  “Simulate the performance of a chemical sensor” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/sensor-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Simulate the performance of a chemical sensor/Simulate the performance of a chemical sensor_01_Usability_smk.org][Simulate the performance of a chemical sensor_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the PH Simulator link 
  2. It should re-direct to the PH Simulator page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for PH Simulator' link
  4. Select the PH value from the dropdown list displayed on the screen and click on the 'plot' button
  5. Now click on the escape button through keyboard or close button
  6. Click on the level 2 button and select the sample value from the dropdown list displayed on the screen
  7. Click on the formula button and enter the Output Voltage value in the corresponding field using the formula displayed on the screen and click on submit button
  8. Click on get temperature button and click on plot button click on close button and then click on the level 2 button 
  9. Now click on the reload button

* Expected result
  1. PH Simulator page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new page should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The pH and OUTPUT mV values should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the plot button, a popup box with the result ghraph should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the close button the popup box should be closed
  6. The level2 simulation page should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the formula button a new tab should get opebed with the formula displayed on the page
  7. When we click on the submit button the value should get submitted and when we click on the level 3 button the level 3 simulation page should be displayed on the screen 
  8. The temperature value should get displayed on the screen and wwhen we click on the plot button the simulation result graph should be displayed on the screen
  9. when we click on close button the the popup box should get closed and when we click on the level 2 button, the previous simulation page should be displayed on the screen
  10. The page should get reloaded and the values entered should get erased from the corresponding fields
